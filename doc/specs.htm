<li> Also think having an area to enter workout data would be a great addition: steps, miles, calories burned, time, etc.</li>
<li> I'd like to use 24-hr format with times, and choose a different date spread between my best/worst/average page, and the graph over time.</li>
<li>Track medicamentation</li>
<li>Important stages - like medication started, changed, change in lifestyle etc.</li>

<li>Pulse Pressure & MAP</li>
<li>stat filter for "rested" vs "active" as I'm needing to monitor both and it skews my average</li>
<li>Pre & post food would be useful options too</li>
<li>record pulse pressure & active readings</li>
<li>User Comments</li>
<li> It would be helpful if in the account section I could list all the meds I am currently taking</li>
<li>check my BP both sitting and standing</li>
<li> stop watch to check your pulse</li>
<li>large icons & type</li>
<li>when entering systolic/diastolic, field jumping is automatic without having to tab or select the next field, but pulse is separate. I wish field jumping was automatic for all three</li>
<li>app sync with multiple devices to a cloud accoun</li>
<li> If only it could be set for different age groups</li>
<li> I will like to have height & BMI included.</li>
<li>It's so cool to see the averages for each time of day too</li>
<li> Also doesn't graph by time of day, eg all the readings taken in the morning.</li>
<li> Need to add to change max min scale at bp graph</li>
<li> it is preferable not to type in the weight each time as this does not change every day</li>
<li>Would be nice if you could add weight loss to the app</li>
<li>show some warning with high blood reading</li>
<li>Sodium tracker, food look-up, and charts are excellent!!! Has helped my BP with knowledge of sodium intake daily</li>
<li> I could delete all old history at one time instead of doing it one record at a time. My Doctor likes it because I can print out the BP results and give them to him so he can add them to my Medical Chart.</li>
<li>easy entry and tracking of ortho static pressure.</li>
<li> I just missed share for social networks</li>
<li> Wish it did include blood sugar</li>
<li>themes or be able to change the look a little. </li>
<li>Bar graph.</li>
<li>Tags - define short descriptions and use them repeatedly. Tag categories?</li>
<li>Compact printing of results.</li>
<li> It would be perfect if you added a possibility to take a photo of the display blood pressure monitor and recognized the values</li>
<li> There is no place for right arm for left arm. You can't put whether you were sitting standing or lying. </li>
<li> On the graph jumbled up if you have to take your blood pressure every couple hours</li>
<li> Being colour blind I find it difficult to tell between the green and yellow - perhaps an option to customise colours?</li>
<li> It should take into account the age and gender of the user. Blood presure is not the same for an 18, 40, or 60 man or woman.</li>
<li> would like to be able to see more than just the last 30 days on the pie chart view,</li>
<li> Statistic reports on blood pressure including max/mean/average for given time periods (morning/day/evening/night)</li>
<li>Classification of blood pressure measurement based on the WHO / ISH Hypertension guidelines</li>
<li> Automated data retrieval from Bluetooth enabled AND blood pressure monitors (UA-767PBT, UA-851PBT, UA-911PBT)</li>
<li>Place of pressure measurement</li>
<li>Body position during measurement</li>
<li>Weight in kilograms or pounds</li>
